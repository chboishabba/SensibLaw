authoring_guidance:
  naming: >-
    Use concise, system-scoped codes (e.g., "assault_common", "mana_defamation")
    that combine conduct plus distinguishing context. Pair each code with a
    human-readable label that mirrors how practitioners refer to the wrong.
  versioning: >-
    Start new wrong types at version "v1". Increment to v2/v3 when doctrinal
    elements materially change; keep prior versions for traceability to earlier
    decisions or statutory regimes.
  citations: >-
    Each wrong type should carry at least one authoritative LegalSource citation
    (statute section, leading case, tikanga reference). Store pinpoint text in
    `wrong_type_source.pinpoint` when available and record the relation type
    (defines, creates, leading_case, commentary) to preserve provenance.
