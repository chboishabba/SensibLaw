# Panopticon Refusal Manifesto (ITIR/SensibLaw)

## Preamble
Surveillance is not defined by cameras, logs, or storage. Surveillance is defined
by who is allowed to interpret memory, and with what authority. Memory becomes
coercive when capture is asymmetric, interpretation is centralized, forgetting
is invisible, and records are treated as truth rather than artifacts.

This document states what ITIR/SensibLaw **will not become** regardless of
pressure, incentives, or convenience.

## 1. What the system refuses
ITIR/SensibLaw refuses the panopticon model: subjects legible to power while
power remains illegible to subjects. The system is opinionated against coercive
memory.

## 2. Red-Flag Features We Will Never Support

### 2.1 Authoritative interpretation
Never:
- auto-label behavior as good/bad/compliant/risky
- assign moral/legal/psychological meaning to events
- output findings, verdicts, or assessments

### 2.2 Global or cross-context identity resolution
Never:
- unify identities across contexts by default
- infer the same person across domains
- merge home/work/medical/legal timelines automatically

### 2.3 Hidden or passive capture
Never:
- silently record
- infer intent without declaration
- capture data without visible provenance

### 2.4 Predictive or preemptive judgment
Never:
- forecast behavior
- score risk
- simulate future compliance
- produce early-warning flags about people

### 2.5 Compression that conceals meaning
Never:
- summarize away uncertainty
- collapse disagreement into a single narrative
- compress without declared loss profiles

### 2.6 Centralized memory authority
Never:
- designate a canonical history
- auto-reconcile competing accounts
- privilege institutional memory over personal memory

Plurality is the safeguard.

## 3. The Right to Opacity
Right to Opacity means an actor or context may remain partially unreadable and
uninterpreted by default. Opacity is refusal of forced legibility.

Opacity is enforced through:
- absence-as-signal
- non-promotion of semantics
- refusal to normalize across domains
- explicit loss-profile declarations
- separation of hypothesis from commitment

## 4. Hypothesis vs Commitment
Hypothesis is provisional and reversible. Commitment is declared and auditable.
No inference crosses that boundary automatically.

## 5. UI Affordances That Resist Interpretation
- Absence is loud and visible.
- Interpretation requires explicit framing and assumptions.
- Competing views are shown side-by-side.
- Status badges are epistemic, not moral.
- Expansion is always possible in principle.

## 6. SB vs FOI vs Surveillance
FOI assumes records are authoritative. Surveillance interprets centrally.
ITIR/SensibLaw captures explicitly, interprets locally, and refuses closure.

## 7. Maximum Acceptable Blast Radius (Restated)
Failures must be local, visible, bounded, and reversible. No silent inference
may persist.

## 8. Final Refusal
The system will never claim to know who someone is, what something means, what
will happen, or what should be done. It records only what was observed, under
which conditions, and with what uncertainty.

## 9. State Power and Structural Violence (Operational-Political Note)
State violence is epistemic first and physical second. Harm begins when records
are treated as authoritative, absence is interpreted as guilt, ambiguity is
resolved unilaterally, and interpretation is enforced rather than debated. This
system exists to introduce epistemic friction against those pipelines.

Refusals include:
- suspicion pipelines (predictive policing, risk scoring, pre-incident flags)
- category promotion that coerces identity across domains
- timelines that collapse ambiguity into intent
- claims that “the log speaks for itself”

Sensor evidence is treated as partial, situated, and lossy. Artifacts and
absences are recorded; conclusions are not. Lawful access does not imply
interpretive authority.
