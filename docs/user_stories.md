# User Stories (Work/Home, Legal/Therapeutic Boundaries)

Purpose: capture day-in-the-life narratives that pressure-test ITIR/SensibLaw
invariants without collapsing epistemic boundaries. These are **stories**, not
requirements; they must align with the doctrine: explicit status, no silent
promotion, and visible absences.

## Persona 1 — Lawyer

Profile:
- Senior litigation lawyer.
- High interruption rate, high consequence of factual drift.
- Uses SensibLaw at work; uses ITIR/TiRCorder at home (no corpus access).

### At Work (court + chambers)
Morning case preparation:
- Reviews provisions/principles in SensibLaw.
- SB records review activity and tool envelopes (search, extract, annotate).
- ITIR ingests references only; no summaries, no semantic rewriting.
- Invariant: SB never claims meaning or strength of argument.

Midday drafting:
- Dictates/edits arguments.
- TiRCorder captures raw speech; SB records session structure.
- ITIR preserves divergent trajectories as hypotheses; no collapse.
- Invariant: disagreement and backtracking are preserved, not corrected.

Afternoon client meeting:
- Client instructions are recorded as **commitments (external)** with provenance.
- SB does not interpret or reconcile contradictions.
- Invariant: declared intent is recorded without inference.

End-of-day review:
- Daily brief shows timeline, unresolved threads, absences.
- No “progress” judgments or prioritization.
- Invariant: “what happened” only.

### At Home (evening/weekend)
- No SensibLaw corpus access.
- TiRCorder captures personal speculation.
- SB/ITIR stores hypotheses explicitly labeled as such.
- Invariant: private speculation never becomes professional commitment.

## Persona 2 — Psychologist

Profile:
- Clinical psychologist working with high-risk material.
- Extremely sensitive to narrative drift and suggestion effects.
- Uses SensibLaw for ethics/obligations at work; ITIR/TiRCorder at home.

### At Work (clinical setting)
Session:
- TiRCorder captures therapist reflections and uncertainty.
- SB records session boundaries, pauses, and interruptions.
- ITIR preserves conflicting accounts without resolution.
- Invariant: no diagnosis inference; no story compression.

After-session reflection:
- Competing hypotheses recorded as hypotheses with explicit status.
- ITIR may surface contradictions but never resolves truth.
- Invariant: uncertainty remains explicit.

Supervision/documentation:
- SensibLaw consulted for reporting/consent obligations.
- SB records which rules were consulted, when.
- Invariant: no advice generation; references only.

### At Home
- Personal reflections are recorded as hypotheses (private).
- Later review distinguishes personal reflection from clinical observation.
- Invariant: home context never leaks into professional commitments.

## Shared boundary rules (non-negotiable)
- Sequence is preserved; order matters more than interpretation.
- Epistemic status is explicit (hypothesis/intention/projection/commitment).
- Absence is visible and queryable; no silent fill-in.
- Context boundaries are enforced (home/work, private/professional).
- No automatic promotion; commitments require explicit action and receipts.

## Why this matters
Both professions cannot afford silent drift. SB/ITIR exists to ensure:
- memory does not lie
- speculation does not become authority
- context does not leak across domains

## Additional roles (stress tests)

### Banker (institutional risk)
- Work: execution envelopes capture model runs, versions, declared intent, and host/toolchain.
- Home: private risk concerns remain hypotheses; no promotion into work commitments.
- Failure prevented: hindsight laundering and retroactive certainty.

### CEO (strategy under ambiguity)
- Work: pivots and unresolved threads preserved without narrative overwrite.
- Home: speculative thoughts remain hypotheses.
- Failure prevented: false inevitability and post-hoc rationalization.

### Middle manager (coordination pressure)
- Work: meetings yield commitments only when explicit; absences are recorded.
- Home: stress reflections remain private hypotheses.
- Failure prevented: responsibility inversion and gaslighting.

### Removalist (sequence + safety)
- Work: instruction changes and task sequencing preserved; no blame inference.
- Home: fatigue markers remain non-authoritative.
- Failure prevented: blame without context.

### Barista (tempo + interruptions)
- Work: rush periods and equipment issues recorded; no personal judgment.
- Failure prevented: misattribution of fault.

### Barrister (forensic reasoning)
- Work: argument chains preserved as hypotheses vs commitments.
- Home: rehearsals remain private hypotheses.
- Failure prevented: mixing rehearsal with evidence.

### Air force pilot (life-critical)
- Work: training vs live runs separated; deviations recorded without inference.
- Home: reflection never merges with operational commitments.
- Failure prevented: training/live confusion.

### Mechanic (diagnosis under uncertainty)
- Work: tests and parts replaced recorded in sequence.
- Home: tentative diagnosis remains hypothesis.
- Failure prevented: cargo-cult repairs and overconfidence.

## Organization-level narratives (admins, teams, regulators)

These extend the individual stories with **team/admin/org** perspectives. The
rules are fixed: individuals own intent, orgs own commitments, aggregates never
overwrite individual timelines, and admins cannot “clean up” history.

### Banker → Bank → Regulators
- Team view: exploratory runs vs committee-approved commitments are distinct.
- Admin view: envelopes, model versions, declared commitments, timestamps only.
- Forbidden: reclassifying exploration as approval; collapsing dissent.
- Failure prevented: retrospective laundering and scapegoating.

### CEO → Exec Team → Board
- Team view: pivots, unresolved tensions, and decision gaps are preserved.
- Board view: commitment timelines and dependency chains only.
- Forbidden: converting private speculation into official direction.
- Failure prevented: strategy myth-making and narrative overwrite.

### Middle Manager → Department → HR/Ops
- Team view: unresolved blockers and handoff failures are explicit.
- Admin view: workload density, interruption patterns, system bottlenecks.
- Forbidden: private reflections; blame narratives without commitments.
- Failure prevented: gaslighting and unfair performance review dynamics.

### Removalist → Crew → Logistics Admin
- Team view: instruction changes and constraints remain visible.
- Admin view: route changes, staffing gaps, equipment issues only.
- Forbidden: rewriting instructions after the fact.
- Failure prevented: worker scapegoating and unsafe speed pressure.

### Barista → Store → Chain HQ
- Team view: rush periods, staffing mismatches, equipment failures.
- HQ view: throughput vs staffing; absence of slack.
- Forbidden: individual “mistakes” as primary narrative.
- Failure prevented: blame-based management and churn.

### Barrister → Chambers → Courts
- Team view: research timelines and evidentiary references.
- Oversight view: due diligence and ethical boundary evidence.
- Forbidden: speculative rehearsal treated as evidence.
- Failure prevented: conflating speculation with fact.

### Air Force Pilot → Squadron → Command
- Team view: training vs live runs, deviations, environmental context.
- Command view: pattern-level deviations and training gaps.
- Forbidden: rewriting procedures post-incident.
- Failure prevented: cover-ups and chilled reporting.

### Mechanic → Shop → Fleet/Manufacturer
- Team view: test sequences and part swaps.
- Fleet view: failure clusters and diagnostic ambiguity.
- Forbidden: personal guesswork framed as certainty.
- Failure prevented: cargo-cult fixes and warranty disputes.

## Public sector (police/EMS/health/government)

### Police / EMS / Health (front-line emergency)
- Individual view: execution envelopes capture timing, procedure references, and explicit absences.
- Team view: handoff gaps, timing overlaps, tool availability failures.
- Oversight view: sequence reconstruction and systemic stressors only.
- Forbidden: intent inference, “who hesitated,” or emotional-state capture.
- Failure prevented: post-hoc reconstruction, absence treated as success.

### Government (administration/regulators/elected officials)
- Civil service view: policy issuance/amendments/exceptions recorded with timelines.
- Regulator view: immutable sequences, declared commitments, and explicit absences.
- Elected officials: commitments only; no strategy or persuasion capture.
- Forbidden: post-hoc sanitization, semantic relabeling, or centralized truth fusion.
- Failure prevented: policy drift myth-making and vendor-dependency collapse.

### Shared danger zone (explicit guardrails)
- No real-time authority or recommendations.
- Absence-as-signal is mandatory.
- Epistemic separation enforced (hypothesis ≠ commitment).

## Trauma-affected primary user (anonymised)

> Persona note (non-user-facing): primary user lives with long-term psychological
> injury; memory can be non-linear and fragmented; forced coherence or loss of
> context is itself harmful. The system must privilege safety and agency over
> completeness or speed.

### ITIR
- Record without explaining: user can log an event fragment with no motive,
  interpretation, or emotional label; "unknown / not ready" is terminal.
- Preserve context with gaps: approximate dates, relative ordering, and
  confidence flags are accepted; no auto-fill or timeline coercion.
- Safe review: progressive disclosure by default; no surprise expansion; no
  auto-surfaced "related" events.
- Coexisting truths: conflicting accounts can persist without reconciliation or
  canonical preference.

### SB
- Patterns without conclusions: optional overlays for repetition/proximity;
  never diagnoses, moral claims, or causal assertions.
- Anti case-study: no automatic summaries or "insights"; any synthesis requires
  explicit action and declares omissions.

### Cross-suite (Right to Context)
- Prevent decontextualized sharing: exports include context envelopes by
  default; removing context triggers warnings and immutable logs.
- Right to not know: "unknown" is a valid end state; no reminders to "complete"
  stories; no progress metrics tied to completeness; no nudging toward
  interpretation.

### Explicit non-goals
- No diagnosis, intent inference, timeline enforcement, credibility ranking, or
  clarity-over-safety optimization.
- No preference for institutional readability over user agency.
- Cross-agency fusion is opt-in, delayed, and non-reversible by default.

## Modern org stack (dev → team → CEO → finance)

### Individual developer (home + work)
- Captures execution envelopes (builds/tests/scripts) + prompt hashes.
- Hypothesis vs commitment is explicit (experiments vs merges/deploys).
- Absence-as-signal: missing tests, unavailable CI, missing logs.
- Value: externalized working memory without judgment.

### Dev team (shared truth, not shared control)
- Aggregates patterns (failure motifs, systemic absences) without naming names.
- No ranking, no effort inference, no private exploration exposed.
- Value: coordinated reality without blame inflation.

### CEO (strategic, non-operational)
- Sees commitment timelines, decision latency, bottleneck signals.
- Does not see prompts, hypotheses, or individual tool usage.
- Value: strategy radar, not surveillance.

### Finance (commitments only)
- Prices commitments and reversals, not exploration time.
- No individual productivity scoring; no hypothesis-level costs.
- Value: cost attribution without killing uncertainty.

### Cross-cut: Hypothesis vs commitment
- Explicit transitions; no silent promotion.
- Prevents retro narratives and KPI theater.

### Cross-cut: Absence-as-signal
- Missing tests/metrics/CI are recorded and queryable.
- Prevents false confidence and post-hoc patching.

## Air-gapped / battlefield / Palantir interoperability

### Prime constraint
- SB/ITIR is never the commander or planner; it is the memory substrate.

### State vs non-state coordination
- State-style systems centralize truth and action; SB must not inherit their authority.
- Federated systems share signals, not commands; SB aligns naturally with this.

### Execution envelope normalization
- All operational artifacts reduce to envelopes (time window, modality, host/toolchain, hashes).
- No plans/predictions/commands are stored as commitments.

### Operational planning (danger zone)
- Plans are ingested as **hypotheses**, never commitments.
- SB records when plans existed and when execution diverged.

### Drones / cams / telemetry (local-first)
- Devices write locally; export hashes + metadata only.
- Raw artifacts remain local; SB records absence signals (dropouts, obstruction).

### Absence-as-signal (critical)
- Missing telemetry is explicit and queryable; no silent “all clear.”

### Interop with Palantir-like systems
- External outputs are ingested as non-authoritative annotations only.
- SB never promotes these to commitments or action boundaries.

### Local sovereignty
- Append-only, schema-validated, air-gapped by default.
- Cross-node exchange is facts-only; interpretations are refused.

## Activist coordination (Greenpeace-style)

### Organizer reality
- Long timelines, legal risk, uneven training, rotating roles.
- SB used for memory/accountability, not live command.

### Before action (planning)
- Declared intent + constraints recorded; tactics excluded.
- Legal context snapshots recorded.
- Absence markers explicitly note what is not recorded.

### During action (live)
- No real-time synthesis or classification.
- Raw artifacts captured locally; SB stays quiet.

### After action (reconstruction)
- Observer logs, arrest times, media/police statements ingested as artifacts.
- Competing accounts preserved side-by-side; absences visible.

### Coordination with lawyers/observers/media
- Scoped access by role (legal observers, media, allied orgs).
- Artifacts are content-addressed; loss profiles explicit.
- No global dashboard or merged database.

### Red lines
- No participant ranking, risk scoring, or predictive escalation.
- No “suspicious behavior” flags.

## Trauma + authoritarian pressure (resilience without coercion)

### Core risks
- Temporal disorientation, memory erosion, forced narratives, administrative exhaustion.
- Internal mistrust and burnout masked as personal failure.

### What SB/ITIR must not do
- Centralize truth or collapse uncertainty into scores.
- Infer intent, predict behavior, or rank risk.
- Merge identities across domains or automate suspicion.

### What SB/ITIR provides
- Epistemic stabilization: preserves ambiguity and fragmented recall.
- Absence-as-signal: silence is valid and explicit.
- Hypothesis vs commitment separation protects against self-incrimination.
- Layered time: retroactive annotation and parallel timelines allowed.

### Individual → group → movement scale
- Individuals: external memory prosthesis without judgment.
- Groups: shared memory without forced consensus.
- Movements: federated memory with local sovereignty and auditable exchange.

### Hostile state context
- Local-first, air-gapped, append-only by default.
- Non-operational posture; documentation without command logic.

## Access scopes + legal reconstruction (activist/observer/lawyer/media)

### Access scope invariants
- Read-only for all roles; no mutation of primary records.
- Absence and redaction are visible and distinct.
- Provenance is mandatory; exclusions declared.
- No inference surfaces (no scoring, intent detection, prediction).

### Observer scope
- Can access: time-bounded activity events, counts, provenance, absences.
- Cannot access: identities beyond role-safe pseudonyms, hypotheses, intent labels.
- UI: “observational only” banner + exclusion watermark.

### Lawyer scope
- Can access: full events with identifiers (where lawful), chain-of-custody, redaction history.
- Explicit split: admissible facts vs hypotheses (non-evidentiary).
- Export: court-safe bundle only.

### Media scope
- Can access: anonymized timelines, verified counts, uncertainty markers.
- Cannot access: raw identities, privileged material, internal hypotheses.
- UI: “not a complete record” banner + disputed/absent markers.

### Post-action reconstruction (defensive)
- Freeze window → align events → separate fact/hypothesis/absence → export.
- Drift analysis uses counts only; no motive inference.

### Infiltration stress-test (defensive)
- No trust amplification; inputs remain hypotheses until corroborated.
- Provenance and capture distance always visible.
- No operational surfaces or “next steps.”

## Judicial context (judges, staff, bailiffs, family)

### Core principle
- SB provides memory hygiene and scope control, never judgment support.

### Judge (professional use)
- Case-local memory discipline: hearings, exhibits (hashes), rulings, procedural events.
- Hypotheses are private, non-exportable, time-scoped; commitments are rulings only.
- Absence-as-signal prevents filling gaps from memory.

### Judicial staff (clerks/associates)
- Log procedural facts, filings, deadlines, explicit absences.
- Forbidden: summaries, narrative framing, strength ranking.

### Bailiffs / court officers
- Log objective events (removals, delays, security incidents) with timestamps.
- Forbidden: intent attribution or behavioral labels.

### Family members (extremely constrained)
- Non-case access only: workload patterns, schedule load.
- Forbidden: case details, parties, outcomes, topics.

### Absolute red lines
- No outcome suggestions or “similar case” surfacing.
- No predictive appeal success or public reaction modeling.
- No judge consistency scoring or argument ranking.


## Context fields (weather / market / astronomy / astrology)

Principle: external fields of force, not facts about the user. Align by time/place only; never drive inference, advice, alerts, or prioritisation.

- Weather: optional band of observed readings; no behavioural claims (e.g., "heat caused...").
- Market: index/volatility strips only; no portfolio inference, profit framing, or nudges; label "public market context (non-personal)".
- Astronomy: sunrise/sunset/moon glyphs; optional shading; never prescriptive.
- Astrology: symbolic overlay, opt-in, visual-only, labeled "symbolic / non-causal"; never auto-attached to events.
- Exports/summaries must declare whether context fields are included/excluded; removing context logs a loss entry.

## Explicit non-goals (context & interpretation)
- No causal language ("caused, influenced, impacted") in context panels.
- No risk/advice/diagnosis derived from context fields.
- No automatic linkage of symbolic overlays to events.


## Plural temporal/knowledge users (farmer, symbolic cycles)

### Farmer
- Uses seasons/phenology, distrusts "insights"; enables LES overlays for slow variables (rainfall memory, frost windows, heat load) and optional regional Indigenous seasonal calendars.
- SB entries: situated actions (“delayed planting”, “moved stock”) stamped with LES snapshot; no system explanation.
- ITIR: browse by season; replay environment alongside actions without advice.

### Symbolic/astrology-oriented user
- Enables astronomical state and optional symbolic calendar (opt-in, labeled non-causal).
- SB holds self-authored meaning only (“felt unsettled”, “waited”); system never links symbols to behaviour.
- ITIR: overlays symbolic cycles parallel to events; togglable; no fusion.

### Same person is both
- LES hosts multiple models side-by-side (meteorological, agro-ecological, Indigenous seasonal, symbolic) without merging or prioritising.
- SB logs actions/notes without forced justification; ambiguity allowed.
- ITIR replays time with multiple models visible; user notices patterns, system asserts none.

### Anti-collapse rules
- No causal/normative claims tying context to behaviour (e.g., “because Mercury retrograde”, “productivity dropped due to drought”).
- No merging of Indigenous calendars into Gregorian; no translation of symbolic systems into advice.
- Explicit model provenance and type (environmental vs symbolic) in overlays.
