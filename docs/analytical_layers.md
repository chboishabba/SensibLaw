# Analytical Layers

These diagnostic layers help negotiators interpret weighting differences and identify leverage points across competing proposals. Each layer highlights a distinct perspective on value gaps and potential concessions.

| Layer | What it reveals |
| --- | --- |
| **Conflict Index** | Shows the difference between each party's weightings, producing a "heat map" of contentious issues that demand focused attention. |
| **Trade Potential Index** | Flags opposing items where one party places significantly higher value than the other, signalling high-leverage trade opportunities. |
| **Blind Spot Detector** | Surfaces items undervalued by the opponent, creating quiet win opportunities that can be secured with minimal pushback. |
| **Concession Map** | Visualises where small surrenders by one side can unlock outsized goodwill or offset other imbalances across the negotiation. |
