# Multi-Modal System Doctrine (ITIR/SensibLaw)

## Summary
The system is a single stack with multiple operating modes. It can assist,
remember, schedule, and organise at human speed while enforcing provenance,
consistency, and ground truth at machine speed. These roles coexist only if
epistemic status is explicit and authority never crosses boundaries silently.

## Operating Modes

### Assistive (low authority, reversible)
- Listens, captures, reminds, surfaces relevant context, suggests links.
- Never commits facts or asserts obligations.
- Maps to TiRCorder + ITIR L0–1 + read-only query surfaces.

### Intent-tracking (human-declared, soft state)
- Tasks exist as intentions, not truth.
- Tasks are mutable, allowed to be wrong, and may contradict reality.
- ITIR links tasks to evidence and warns on stale assumptions.

### Temporal projection (non-authoritative scheduling)
- Separates fact-time (effective dates, change points) from plan-time (deadlines).
- Projects fact-time into plan-time without hallucinating urgency.

### Lossless memory (durable, slow)
- Preserves claims, evidence, and epistemic status.
- Resists narrative drift and identity mutation.

### Life OS (orchestration, not control)
- Shared substrate across domains; common identity/time/evidence models.
- Composes with other tools without centralising control.

### Ground truth substrate (authoritative, immutable)
- Spans are real; provenance mandatory; promotion explicit.
- Regeneration and determinism are required.
- No other layer may contradict this one.

### Provenance engine (evidence-first)
- Answers "where did this come from?" and "what supports it?"
- Provenance is primary data, not decoration.

### Consistency referee (skeptical, slow)
- Surfaces contradictions without forcing resolution.
- Makes inconsistencies visible; never acts on them.

## Epistemic status is the invariant
The system must always distinguish these states and never auto-promote:

| Thing | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Thought | Hypothesis |
| Task | Intention |
| Schedule | Projection |
| Note | Narrative |
| Span | Evidence |
| Promoted node | Commitment |

## Doctrine sentence
ITIR/SensibLaw is a multi-modal life system: it assists, remembers, schedules,
and organises at human speed while enforcing provenance, consistency, and ground
truth at machine speed—with explicit boundaries between intent, hypothesis, and
commitment.
