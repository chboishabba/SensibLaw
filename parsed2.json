Examples— 1 On 31 March 2015, the Treasurer publishes a 3% change in the value of a penalty unit. On 30 June 2015 the amount of the penalty unit is $115. The amount prescribed by regulation on 1 July 2015 may be $118.45. 2 The Treasurer has not, on or before 31 March 2015, published a percentage change in the value of a penalty unit. On 30 June 2015, the amount of the penalty unit is $115. The amount prescribed by regulation on 1 July 2015 may be $119. (3) If the amount worked out under subsection (2) is not a multiple of 5 cents, the amount must be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5 cents. (4) For subsection (2), if an amount has not been prescribed under this section, the amount last prescribed is taken to be $110. (5) A regulation may only prescribe 1 increase for an amount for a financial year.

(2) In considering whether or not to record a conviction, a court must have regard to all circumstances of the case, including— (a) (b) (c) the nature of the offence; and the offender’s character and age; and the impact that recording a conviction will have on the offender’s— (i) economic or social wellbeing; or (ii) chances of finding employment. (3) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this or another Act— (a) (b) a conviction without recording the conviction is taken not to be a conviction for any purpose; and the conviction must not be entered in any records except— (i) (ii) in the records of the court before which the offender was convicted; and in the offender’s criminal history but only for the purposes of subsection (4)(b).

(7) Despite subsection (6), the second court is not required to record the conviction for the offence if— (a) the offender is the subject of a community service order or probation order; and Page 48 Current as at 20 September 2025 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 2 Governing principles [s 12A] (b) the reason the court is dealing with the offender for the same offence is because the offender has applied for a revocation of the community service order or probation order; and (c) the offender has not breached the community service order or probation order. 12A Convictions for offences relating to domestic violence (1) Subsections (2) to (4) apply if— (a) a complaint or an indictment for a charge for an offence states the offence is also 1 of the following offences (each a relevant domestic violence offence)— (i) a domestic violence offence; (ii) a domestic violence offence committed against a child; (iii) a domestic violence offence that exposed a child to domestic violence; and (b) the offender is convicted of the offence. (2) If a conviction is recorded in relation to the offence, it must also be recorded as a conviction for a relevant domestic violence offence. Example— An indictment for a charge for an offence states the offence is also a domestic violence offence committed against a child. The offender is convicted of the offence. If a conviction is recorded in relation to the offence, it must also be recorded as a conviction for ‘a domestic violence offence committed against a child’. (3) If no conviction is recorded in relation to the offence, the offence must be entered in the offender’s criminal history as a relevant domestic violence offence. (4) However, a matter must not be recorded or entered under subsection (2) or (3) in relation to the offence if the court makes an order to the effect it is not satisfied the offence is also a relevant domestic violence offence. Current as at 20 September 2025 Page 49 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 2 Governing principles [s 12A] Note— (5) See the Evidence Act 1977, section 132C, which provides for the sentencing judge or magistrate in any sentencing procedure in a criminal proceeding to act on allegations of fact. If a court convicts an offender of an offence for which a matter must be recorded or entered under subsection (2) or (3) or of an offence against the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 2012, part 7, the prosecution may apply to the court for an order that an offence, stated in the application, of which the offender has previously been convicted (a previous offence)— (a) (b) for a previous offence for which a conviction was recorded—also be recorded as a conviction for a relevant domestic violence offence; or otherwise—be entered in the offender’s criminal history as a relevant domestic violence offence. (6) The application— (a) may be made in writing or orally; and (b) must include enough information to allow the court to make a decision about whether it is appropriate to make the order. (7) The court may ask the prosecutor for further information for it to decide whether to make an order under subsection (8). (8) If, after considering the application, the court is satisfied a previous offence is a relevant domestic violence offence, the court must order that the offence— (a) (b) for a previous offence for which a conviction was recorded—also be recorded as a conviction for a relevant domestic violence offence; or otherwise—be entered in the offender’s criminal history as a relevant domestic violence offence. (9) Each of the following persons is not compellable as a witness in proceedings before the court to decide the application— Page 50 Current as at 20 September 2025 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 2 Governing principles [s 13] (a) (b) a person against whom the relevant domestic violence offence was committed; for a relevant domestic violence offence that exposed a child to domestic violence—the child. (10) If a court is satisfied an error has been made in recording or entering an offence as a relevant domestic violence offence, the court may, on an application or its own initiative, correct the error. (11) For this section, proof that an offence is a relevant domestic violence offence lies on the prosecutor. (12) To remove any doubt, it is declared that this section does not require a matter to be recorded or entered in an offender’s traffic history under the Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995. 13 Guilty plea to be taken into account (1) In imposing a sentence on an offender who has pleaded guilty to an offence, a court— (a) must take the guilty plea into account; and (b) may reduce the sentence that it would have imposed had the offender not pleaded guilty. (2) A reduction under subsection (1)(b) may be made having regard to the time at which the offender— (a) (b) pleaded guilty; or informed the relevant law enforcement agency of his or her intention to plead guilty. (3) When imposing the sentence, the court must state in open court that it took account of the guilty plea in determining the sentence imposed. (4) A court that does not, under subsection (2), reduce the sentence imposed on an offender who pleaded guilty must state in open court— (a) that fact; and Current as at 20 September 2025 Page 51 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 2 Governing principles [s 13A] (b) its reasons for not reducing the sentence. (5) A sentence is not invalid merely because of the failure of the court to make the statement mentioned in subsection (4), but its failure to do so may be considered by an appeal court if an appeal against sentence is made. 13A Cooperation with law enforcement authorities to be taken into account—undertaking to cooperate (1) This section applies for a sentence that is to be reduced by the sentencing court because the offender has undertaken to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in a proceeding about an offence, including a confiscation proceeding. (2) Before the sentencing proceeding starts, a party to the proceeding— (a) must advise the relevant officer— (i) (ii) that the offender has undertaken to cooperate with law enforcement agencies; and that written or oral submissions or evidence will be made or brought before the court relevant on that account to the reduction of sentence; and (b) may give to the relevant officer copies of any proposed written submissions mentioned in paragraph (a)(ii). (3) After the offender is invited to address the court— (a) (b) the offender’s written undertaking to cooperate with law enforcement agencies must be handed up to the court; and any party may hand up to the court written submissions relevant to the reduction of sentence.

(2) (3) If the offender had a current parole eligibility date, the court must fix the date the offender is eligible for parole. If the offender had a current parole release date, the court may fix the date the offender is eligible for parole. (4) A date fixed under subsection (2) or (3) must not be earlier than the current parole eligibility date or current parole release date mentioned in the subsection for the offender.

Note— See also section 160F. 160D Sentence for a serious violent offence or sexual offence (1) This section applies if the offender’s period of imprisonment includes a term of imprisonment for a serious violent offence or a sexual offence. (2) (3) If the offender had a current parole eligibility date or current parole release date, the court must fix the date the offender is eligible for parole. If subsection (2) does not apply, the court may fix the date the offender is eligible for parole.

Note— See also section 160F. 160E Automatic cancellation of parole release or eligibility dates (1) An offender’s parole release date is automatically cancelled when— (a) (b) a court fixes another parole release date or parole eligibility date for the offender under this division; or a court imposes a term of imprisonment on the offender— (i) (ii) for a serious violent offence or a sexual offence; or results that imprisonment being more than 3 years. the offender’s period of in (2) An offender’s parole eligibility date is automatically cancelled when— Current as at 20 September 2025 Page 205 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 9 Imprisonment [s 160F] (a) (b) a court fixes another parole eligibility date for the offender under this division; or a court imposes a term of imprisonment on the offender— (i) (ii) for a serious violent offence or a sexual offence; or results that imprisonment being more than 3 years. the offender’s period of in Example— O is sentenced to a 5-year term of imprisonment on 1 March 2007. The sentencing court fixes O’s parole eligibility date at 1 October 2009. On 1 April 2010, O, whose application for parole in relation to the first term of imprisonment was unsuccessful, is sentenced to a further term of 2 years imprisonment to be served cumulatively with the first term. O’s parole eligibility date of 1 October 2009 is cancelled under subparagraph (ii) and, under section 160C(2), the court must again fix a date that O is eligible for parole. (3) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect even though the court fixing the relevant date or imposing the further term of imprisonment is a court of lesser jurisdiction than the court that fixed the current parole release date or current parole eligibility date being cancelled under the subsection. 160F Significance of an offender’s period of imprisonment (1) One of the objects of sections 160A to 160E is to ensure that at any 1 time there is only 1 parole release date or parole eligibility date in existence for an offender. (2) When fixing a date under this division as the date an offender is to be released on parole or is to be eligible for release on parole, the date fixed by the court must be a date relating to the offender’s period of imprisonment as opposed to a particular term of imprisonment. Examples— 1 O is sentenced to a term of 1 year’s imprisonment on 1 July 2007 with a parole release date of 1 January 2008. O is released on parole on 1 January 2008. On 1 April 2008, O is sentenced to a further term of 1 year’s imprisonment for another offence. A parole Page 206 Current as at 20 September 2025 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 9 Imprisonment [s 160G] eligibility date fixed for O under section 160B(2) must relate to the 2 years period of imprisonment to which O has been sentenced and must not be earlier than 1 January 2008. 2 O is sentenced to a term of 1 year’s imprisonment on 1 July 2007 with a parole release date of 1 January 2008. On 1 November 2007, O is sentenced to a further term of 1 year’s imprisonment for another offence, to be served concurrently with the first term. A parole release date fixed for O under section 160B(3) must relate to the 16 months period of imprisonment to which O has been sentenced and must not be earlier than 1 January 2008. 160G Court may fix any day of sentence as parole release date (1) If, under this Act, the court must fix a parole release date for an offender, the court may fix any day of the offender’s sentence as the offender’s parole release date. (2) (3) Examples— 1 An offender who has been held in remand for 7 days is found guilty of an offence and sentenced to 7 days imprisonment. The sentencing court may fix the sentencing day as the offender’s parole release date. 2 An offender is sentenced to 14 days imprisonment for contempt of court. The sentencing court may fix the last day of the sentence as the offender’s parole release date. If the offender’s parole release date is the date the offender is to be unconditionally released from lawful custody, the chief executive (corrective services) is not required to issue a court ordered parole order under the Corrective Services Act 2006, section 199. If the court fixes the date on which an offender is sentenced as the offender’s parole release date and subsection (2) does not apply, the offender is taken immediately to be subject to a court ordered parole order— (a) (b) containing the conditions mentioned in the Corrective Services Act 2006, section 200(1); and requiring the offender to report to a probation and parole office as defined under that Act and obtain a copy of the court ordered parole order between 9a.m. and 5p.m. Current as at 20 September 2025 Page 207 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 9 Imprisonment [s 160H] either on the day the court fixes the offender’s parole release date or on the next business day. Examples— 1 2 The court fixes the offender’s parole release date on a Thursday and the following day (Friday) is not a public holiday. The offender must report to a probation and parole office and obtain a copy of the parole order either before 5p.m. on the Thursday or between 9a.m. and 5p.m. on the Friday. The court fixes the offender’s parole release date on a Friday and the following Monday is not a public holiday. The offender must report to a probation and parole office and obtain a copy of the parole order either before 5p.m. on the Friday or between 9a.m. and 5p.m. on the Monday. (4) An offender who fails to report to a probation and parole office and obtain a copy of the court ordered parole order as required under subsection (3)(b) is unlawfully at large for the Corrective Services Act 2006. (5) A court mentioned in subsection (3) must, when fixing the offender’s parole release date, tell the offender— (a) (b) of the requirement imposed on the offender under the subsection; and of the consequences if the offender fails to comply with the requirement. (6) In this section— court ordered parole order means a court ordered parole order as defined under the Corrective Services Act 2006. 160H Series of sentences involving terms of imprisonment (1) This section applies if— (a) (b) a court is imposing more than 1 term of imprisonment in a series of sentencing orders; and an order (the first order) made by the court in relation to a term of imprisonment under this division would, because of section 160E, be cancelled in the series of sentencing orders by another order made under this Page 208 Current as at 20 September 2025 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 9A Convictions of serious violent offences [s 161A] division or by the imposition of another term of imprisonment. (2) It is not necessary for the court to make the first order but, in making an order under this division that has final effect in relation to the series of sentencing orders, the court may only make an order that it could make if it had made the first order. Example— O has been charged with 3 offences and found guilty of each. The court sentences O to 2 years imprisonment on charge 1, 1 year’s imprisonment on charge 2 and 2 years and 6 months imprisonment on charge 3, the terms to be served concurrently. It is not necessary for the court to make an order fixing a parole release date for each of the offences. The court may make a single order fixing a parole release date for the resulting period of imprisonment which must not be a date earlier in time than a parole release date notionally fixed under any of the previous orders the court would, apart from this section, be required to make. Part 9A Convictions of serious violent offences 161A When an offender is convicted of a serious violent offence An offender is convicted of a serious violent offence if— (a) the offender is— (i) convicted on indictment of an offence— (A) (B) against a provision mentioned in schedule 1; or of counselling or procuring the commission of, or attempting or conspiring to commit, an offence against a provision mentioned in schedule 1; and (ii) sentenced to 10 or more years imprisonment for the offence, calculated under section 161C; or Current as at 20 September 2025 Page 209 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 9A Convictions of serious violent offences [s 161B] (b) the offender is convicted on indictment and declared to be convicted of a serious violent offence under section 161B(3) or (4). 161B Declaration of conviction of serious violent offence (1) If an offender is convicted of a serious violent offence under section 161A(a), the sentencing court must declare the conviction to be a conviction of a serious violent offence as part of the sentence. (2) However, the failure of the sentencing court to make a declaration as required under subsection (1) does not affect the fact that the offender has been convicted of a serious violent offence. (3) If an offender is— (a) convicted on indictment of an offence— (i) against a provision mentioned in schedule 1; or (ii) of counselling or procuring the commission of, or attempting or conspiring to commit, an offence against a provision mentioned in schedule 1; and (b) sentenced to 5 or more, but less than 10, years imprisonment the offence, calculated under section 161C; for the sentencing court may declare the offender to be convicted of a serious violent offence as part of the sentence.

(6) The finite term included in the relevant period of imprisonment is taken to be extended by the gap period. (7) Any term of imprisonment ordered to be served cumulatively with the finite term is taken to be ordered to be served cumulatively with the finite term as extended. (8) In this section— relevant period of imprisonment, for the offender, see section 174(9). 174C Parole provisions on cancellation of parole order (1) This section applies if a parole order under section 174 or 174A is made for an offender and the order is cancelled.

The sentencing court fixes O’s parole eligibility date at 1 October 2009. On 1 April 2010, O, whose application for parole in relation to the first term of imprisonment was unsuccessful, is sentenced to a further term of 2 years imprisonment to be served cumulatively with the first term. O’s parole eligibility date of 1 October 2009 is cancelled under subparagraph (ii) and, under section 160C(2), the court must again fix a date that O is eligible for parole. (3) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect even though the court fixing the relevant date or imposing the further term of imprisonment is a court of lesser jurisdiction than the court that fixed the current parole release date or current parole eligibility date being cancelled under the subsection. 160F Significance of an offender’s period of imprisonment (1) One of the objects of sections 160A to 160E is to ensure that at any 1 time there is only 1 parole release date or parole eligibility date in existence for an offender. (2) When fixing a date under this division as the date an offender is to be released on parole or is to be eligible for release on parole, the date fixed by the court must be a date relating to the offender’s period of imprisonment as opposed to a particular term of imprisonment. Examples— 1 O is sentenced to a term of 1 year’s imprisonment on 1 July 2007 with a parole release date of 1 January 2008. O is released on parole on 1 January 2008. On 1 April 2008, O is sentenced to a further term of 1 year’s imprisonment for another offence. A parole Page 206 Current as at 20 September 2025 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 9 Imprisonment [s 160G] eligibility date fixed for O under section 160B(2) must relate to the 2 years period of imprisonment to which O has been sentenced and must not be earlier than 1 January 2008. 2 O is sentenced to a term of 1 year’s imprisonment on 1 July 2007 with a parole release date of 1 January 2008. On 1 November 2007, O is sentenced to a further term of 1 year’s imprisonment for another offence, to be served concurrently with the first term. A parole release date fixed for O under section 160B(3) must relate to the 16 months period of imprisonment to which O has been sentenced and must not be earlier than 1 January 2008. 160G Court may fix any day of sentence as parole release date (1) If, under this Act, the court must fix a parole release date for an offender, the court may fix any day of the offender’s sentence as the offender’s parole release date. (2) (3) Examples— 1 An offender who has been held in remand for 7 days is found guilty of an offence and sentenced to 7 days imprisonment. The sentencing court may fix the sentencing day as the offender’s parole release date. 2 An offender is sentenced to 14 days imprisonment for contempt of court. The sentencing court may fix the last day of the sentence as the offender’s parole release date. If the offender’s parole release date is the date the offender is to be unconditionally released from lawful custody, the chief executive (corrective services) is not required to issue a court ordered parole order under the Corrective Services Act 2006, section 199. If the court fixes the date on which an offender is sentenced as the offender’s parole release date and subsection (2) does not apply, the offender is taken immediately to be subject to a court ordered parole order— (a) (b) containing the conditions mentioned in the Corrective Services Act 2006, section 200(1); and requiring the offender to report to a probation and parole office as defined under that Act and obtain a copy of the court ordered parole order between 9a.m. and 5p.m. Current as at 20 September 2025 Page 207 Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1992\nPart 9 Imprisonment [s 160H] either on the day the court fixes the offender’s parole release date or on the next business day. Examples— 1 2 The court fixes the offender’s parole release date on a Thursday and the following day (Friday) is not a public holiday. The offender must report to a probation and parole office and obtain a copy of the parole order either before 5p.m. on the Thursday or between 9a.m. and 5p.m. on the Friday. The court fixes the offender’s parole release date on a Friday and the following Monday is not a public holiday. The offender must report to a probation and parole office and obtain a copy of the parole order either before 5p.m. on the Friday or between 9a.m. and 5p.m. on the Monday.
