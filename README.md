Like coleslaw, it just makes sense.

## Installation

Install the package in editable mode to develop locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## CLI

### CLI Commands

#### Retrieve document revisions

Retrieve a document revision as it existed on a given date:

```bash
sensiblaw get --id 1 --as-at 2023-01-01
```

See [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md) for details on the versioned
storage layer and available provenance metadata.

#### Query case treatment

Summarise how later decisions treat a case:

```bash
sensiblaw query treatment --case '[1992] HCA 23'
```

Sample output ordered by weighting of the citing court:

```
FOLLOWS       5
APPLIES       3
CONSIDERS     2
DISTINGUISHES 1
OVERRULES     0
```

Each count represents the weighted sum of citing judgments, with higher courts
contributing more than lower courts. The summary aggregates these weights to
convey the overall reception of the case.
