Like coleslaw, it just makes sense.

## NLP Integration Snapshot

The upcoming spaCy integration is charted in a deliverables matrix that captures the
current regex-centric pipeline and the target state for a fully token-aware flow. For
the full roadmap, including phased milestones and definitions of done, see
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

| Category | **Current State ("As-is")** | **Target State ("To-be")** | **Key Deliverables** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tokenization** | Hand-rolled regex (`\w+`) and manual text splitting. No sentence boundaries, no offsets beyond character indexes. | Deterministic tokenization with sentence boundaries, offsets, and lemmatization from `spaCy` (or Stanza via adapter). | • `src/nlp/spacy_adapter.py` implementing `parse()` → returns `{sents: [{text, start, end, tokens: [{text, lemma, pos, dep, start, end}]}]}`<br>• Unit tests verifying token alignment vs original text (`tests/nlp/test_spacy_adapter.py`). |
| **POS & Lemmas** | None. `normalise()` only lowercases and applies glossary rewrites. | Each token enriched with `POS`, `morph`, and `lemma_` for downstream classification (actor/action/object inference). | • Extend adapter output to include `lemma_`, `pos_`, `morph`.<br>• Add `Token.set_extension("class_", default=None)` for logic tree tagging. |
| **Dependency Parsing** | None. Rule extractors rely on regex (`must`, `if`, `section \d+`). | Dependency tree available per sentence (`nsubj`, `obj`, `aux`, `mark`, `obl`, etc.) for clause role mapping. | • Use `spaCy` built-in parser or `spacy-stanza` (UD).<br>• Expose `get_dependencies()` helper returning role candidates.<br>• Test fixture: “A person must not sell spray paint.” → `nsubj=person`, `VERB=sell`, `obj=spray paint`. |
| **Sentence Segmentation** | Not explicit — one clause per doc or regex breaks on periods. | Automatic sentence boundary detection from spaCy pipeline. | • Enable `sents` iterator from `Doc`.<br>• Add `Sentence` object to data model (`src/models/sentence.py`). |
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | None. Only concept IDs from Aho–Corasick triggers. | Reuse spaCy’s built-in NER (`PERSON`, `ORG`, `LAW`) + optional `EntityRuler` for legal-specific entities. | • `patterns/legal_patterns.jsonl` for Acts, Cases, Provisions.<br>• Integrate `entity_ruler` pipe; expose hits as `REFERENCE` spans. |
| **Rule-based Matchers** | Regex in `rules.py` finds modalities, conditions, and refs manually. | Replace manual regex with `Matcher` and `DependencyMatcher` patterns. | • `src/nlp/rules.py` defining matchers for `MODALITY`, `CONDITION`, `REFERENCE`, `PENALTY`.<br>• Unit tests verifying expected matches per pattern. |
| **Custom Attributes / Logic Tree Hooks** | N/A — logic tree built from scratch after regex tokens. | Every token/span carries `._.class_` = {ACTOR, ACTION, MODALITY,…}, ready for tree builder. | • `Token.set_extension("class_", default=None)`.<br>• Populate via matcher callbacks.<br>• Verify full coverage (no unlabeled non-junk tokens). |
| **Integration into pipeline** | `pipeline.normalise → match_concepts` only. No NLP pipe. | New `pipeline/tokens.py` module invoked between `normalise` and `logic_tree`. | • Update `pipeline/__init__.py`:<br>`tokens = spacy_adapter.parse(normalised_text)`.<br>• Pass token stream to `logic_tree.build(tokens)`. |
| **Fallback / Multilingual** | English-only regex. | Wrapper can swap Stanza/UD when language ≠ "en". | • Optional `SpacyNLP(lang="auto")` detects LID and selects model.<br>• Add `fastText` or Tika LID hook. |
| **Testing & Validation** | No automated linguistic tests. | Deterministic tokenization, POS, dep, and matcher coverage tests. | • `tests/nlp/test_tokens.py` (token counts, sentence segmentation).<br>• `tests/nlp/test_rules.py` (pattern hits).<br>• Golden expected JSON per input sample. |

## Installation

Install the runtime dependencies for a quick setup:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the project along with the development and test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

## Testing

Install the test extras and run the suite. The extras include
[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/), which powers the
project's property-based tests:

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
pytest
```

## Streamlit console

SensibLaw now includes a Streamlit dashboard that mirrors the CLI workflows in an
interactive web interface. The runtime dependency is bundled with the project, so
installing the package in editable mode is sufficient:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Launch the console from the repository root:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### What to try

- **Documents tab** – upload a PDF (or pick the bundled Mabo sample) to run
  `process_pdf`, persist the output via `VersionedStore`, and fetch historical
  snapshots by ID and effective date.
- **Text & Concepts** – paste or load example text to run `normalise`,
  `match_concepts`, `build_cloud`, `extract_rules`, and the sample FastAPI
  helpers for provision tagging and DOT exports.
- **Knowledge Graph** – seed the in-memory graph with demo cases, call
  `generate_subgraph`, `execute_tests`, `fetch_case_treatment`, and
  `fetch_provision_atoms`, and download the resulting payloads.
- **Case Comparison** – load the GLJ silhouette via `load_case_silhouette`,
  upload a story facts JSON payload, and review overlaps/missing factors from
  `compare_story_to_case`.
- **Utilities** – experiment with glossary lookups, frame compilation,
  receipts build/verify, `simhash`, FRL ingestion helpers, rule consistency
  checks, and harm scoring.

The console surfaces progress indicators for long-running tasks and includes
download buttons so you can inspect JSON payloads generated by each helper.

## Automation & Intelligence

The automation layer stitches together the rule extractor, ontology tagger, and
versioned store so negotiators can:

- Parse free-form statements to auto-populate concession weights.
- Simulate scenarios with slider-driven fairness and win/loss projections.
- Cross-check proposed trades against historical compromise corridors.

See [docs/automation_intelligence.md](docs/automation_intelligence.md) for the
full walkthrough of these automation capabilities.

## Reading-Fatigue Killers

Bundles annotated with issues, factors, and deadlines can now be piped through
the reading-focussed utilities in
[docs/reading_fatigue_killers.md](docs/reading_fatigue_killers.md):

- Generate a keyboard-first pin-cite navigator using
  ``build_pin_cite_navigator``.
- Collapse redundant paragraphs across drafts with ``DuplicateDetector``.
- Toggle a "focus lane" view via ``focus_lane`` to keep attention on live
  decision points.

The trio is tuned for the "50-page bundle to first decision in under ten
minutes" workflow and can be wired into bespoke UI layers or console scripts.

## Linting and type checks

Execute all linting and type-check hooks:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Install the package in editable mode along with development dependencies to develop locally:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev,test]
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Development

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the development
dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

Run the test suite and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pytest
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Test fixtures are located in `tests/fixtures`, and reusable templates live in
`tests/templates`.


## CLI Commands

Graph rendering relies on the Graphviz toolchain. Install the system
package separately, for example:

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz  # Debian/Ubuntu
# or
brew install graphviz          # macOS
```

## CLI

### CLI Commands

#### Retrieve document revisions

Retrieve a document revision as it existed on a given date:

```bash
sensiblaw get --id 1 --as-at 2023-01-01
```

Fetch how later authorities have treated a given case:

```bash
sensiblaw query treatment --case case123
```

See [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md) for details on the versioned
storage layer and available provenance metadata.

#### Ingest PDF documents

Extract provisions and atoms from a PDF while writing the structured
[`Document`](src/models/document.py) payload into the SQLite store:

```bash
sensiblaw pdf-fetch data/example.pdf --jurisdiction "NSW" --citation "Act 1994" \
  --db data/store.db
```

#### Build a brief prep pack for counsel

Compile the submission skeletons, coverage grid, counter-argument bank, and
bundle check into a single directory with a counsel-facing PDF:

```bash
sensiblaw brief pack --matter matter.json --out out/brief
```

The command writes `brief_pack.json`, `first_cut_brief.txt`, and the PDF inside
`out/brief`.

To reuse an existing document identifier when appending a new revision:

```bash
sensiblaw pdf-fetch data/amendment.pdf --jurisdiction "NSW" --citation "Act 1994" \
  --db data/store.db --doc-id 42
```

Both commands emit the parsed structure to stdout (and optionally `--output`)
so that downstream tooling can inspect the [`Provision`](src/models/provision.py)
hierarchy, while the `--db/--doc-id` options persist the same structure in the
versioned store.

## Development

Optionally install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run linters and
type checks before each commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The configured hooks will run `ruff`, `black --check`, and `mypy` over the
project's source code.

## CLI Commands

### Match Concepts

Identifies legal concepts in free text based on pattern triggers.

*Required files*: `triggers.json` containing concept patterns.

```bash
sensiblaw concepts match --patterns-file triggers.json --text "permanent stay"
```

Sample output:

```json
[
  "Concept#StayOfProceedings"
]
```

### Explore Graph Subgraphs

Generates a DOT-format subgraph around seed nodes within the knowledge graph.

*Required files*: pre-built graph data (e.g., ontology and case sources under `data/`).

```bash
sensiblaw graph subgraph --node Concept#TerraNullius --node Case#Mabo1992 --hops 2 --dot
```

Sample output:

```dot
digraph {
  "Concept#TerraNullius" -> "Case#Mabo1992"
  // ... additional nodes and edges ...
}
```

### Run Story Tests

Executes scenario tests against a narrative story to verify expected outcomes.

*Required files*: `s4AA.json` containing test definitions and `story.json` with the scenario data.

```bash
sensiblaw tests run --tests-file s4AA.json --story-file story.json
```

Sample output:

```text
3 passed, 0 failed
```

## Development

Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Run lint and type checks:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Run the SensibLaw tests against fixture data:

```bash
sensiblaw tests run tests/fixtures/glj_permanent_stay_story.json
```

## Data ingestion

Download legislation from the Federal Register of Legislation and build a
subgraph for use in proof-tree demos:

```bash
sensiblaw extract frl --act NTA1993 --out data/frl/nta1993.json
```

The command writes a JSON representation of the Native Title Act 1993 to
`data/frl/nta1993.json`.

```bash
python -m src.cli graph subgraph --graph-file data/frl/nta1993.json --node Provision#NTA:s223 --hops 1 --dot
```

This prints a DOT description of the one-hop neighbourhood around
`Provision#NTA:s223`. The JSON graph and DOT output feed into proof-tree demos
that visualise how provisions connect.

### Examples

Distinguish two cases and highlight overlapping reasoning:

```bash
sensiblaw distinguish --base base.json --candidate cand.json
```

The command outputs JSON with shared paragraphs under `"overlaps"` and
unmatched paragraphs under `"missing"`.

Run declarative tests against a story:

```bash
sensiblaw tests run --ids glj:permanent_stay --story story.json
```

The result includes the test name, evaluated factors, and whether the test
`"passed"`.

Extract a portion of the legal knowledge graph:

```bash
sensiblaw graph subgraph --node case123 --hops 2
```

This returns a JSON object with arrays of `"nodes"` and `"edges"` representing
the subgraph around the seed node.

### Distinguish cases

Compare a candidate story against the reported case `[2002] HCA 14`:

```bash
sensiblaw distinguish --case '[2002] HCA 14' --story tests/fixtures/glj_permanent_stay_story.json
```

The command returns JSON with:

* `overlaps` – factors or holdings present in both cases, each with `base` and `candidate` paragraph references.
* `missing` – factors from the cited case absent in the story.
* Paragraph references identify supporting passages via indices and text.

A sample story and silhouette are provided at [tests/fixtures/glj_permanent_stay_story.json](tests/fixtures/glj_permanent_stay_story.json) and [examples/distinguish_glj/glj_silhouette.json](examples/distinguish_glj/glj_silhouette.json).
The comparison is driven by factor packs such as [tests/templates/glj_permanent_stay.json](tests/templates/glj_permanent_stay.json), which encodes the GLJ permanent-stay cues.

#### Query case treatment

Summarise how later decisions treat a case:

```bash
sensiblaw query treatment --case '[1992] HCA 23'
```

Sample output ordered by weighting of the citing court:

```
FOLLOWS       5
APPLIES       3
CONSIDERS     2
DISTINGUISHES 1
OVERRULES     0
```

Each count represents the weighted sum of citing judgments, with higher courts
contributing more than lower courts. The summary aggregates these weights to
convey the overall reception of the case.
